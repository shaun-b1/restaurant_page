# Restaurant Page

Welcome to the Mos Eisley Cantina! This is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase the restaurant's menu and information. I undertook this project as part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum to teach myself about using build tools, in this instance Webpack

## Features
